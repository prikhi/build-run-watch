# Build, Run, Watch

Building, running, & watching utilities for projects with a server & client.

You can use this library to help you write scripts that build projects, run
executables, and watch source files for changes(triggering re-builds).


## TODO

* BuildRunWatch top-level module with high-level functionality. You should be
  able to pass some spec to the main function in this module and it will handle
  argument parsing, building, watching, and help text printing.
* Brick UI with single window or split client/server panes, shortcuts for
  forcing rebuilds or restarting watchers, build result indicators, etc.
